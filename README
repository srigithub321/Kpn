I have used the OOTB Vlocity Components to acheive the requirement
Order is created and associated to PriceList
When order record page is loaded I have used the OmniScript which includes to custom LWC Components (Available Products and Order Products) to display related Products.
Available Products component display all the components that are applicable and all includes "Add to Order" button
Order Products will start displaying products when "Add to order" button in invoked in Available Order component
Activate button in Order Component will create OrderItems and Sets the status of Order to Activated. This is acheived by Calling Intergration Procedure from LWC.
